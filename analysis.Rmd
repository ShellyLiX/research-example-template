## Introduction

This is just an R Markdown document with a bit of code in it that we will use for test purposes. We will be analyzing the ANES data in the output directory.

```{r gender-ed-graph}
ggplot(subset(politics, president!="No Vote" & gender!="Other"), 
       aes(x=president, y=..prop.., group=educ, fill=educ))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  labs(title="Presidential Choice by Education, 2016",
       x=NULL,
       y="percent of education group",
       fill="Education",
       caption="Source: ANES 2016")+
  scale_y_continuous(label=scales::percent)+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdBu")+
  facet_wrap(~gender)+
  theme_dark()
```

```{r voting-income-boxplot}
ggplot(politics, aes(x=reorder(president, income, median), y=income*1000))+
  geom_boxplot(fill="grey", outlier.color="red")+
  scale_y_continuous(label=scales::dollar)+
  labs(x=NULL, y="annual household income",
       title="Comparative boxplots of annual household income by vote",
       caption="Source: ANES 2016")+
  theme_bw()
```

```{r voting-income-violin}
ggplot(politics, aes(x=reorder(president, income, median), y=income*1000))+
  geom_violin(fill="grey", outlier.color="red")+
  scale_y_continuous(label=scales::dollar)+
  labs(x=NULL, y="annual household income",
       title="Comparative violin plots of annual household income by vote",
       caption="Source: ANES 2016")+
  theme_bw()
```

```{r models, results='asis'}

              data=subset(politics, president=="Trump" | president=="Clinton"), 
              family = binomial)
